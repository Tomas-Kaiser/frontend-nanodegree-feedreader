The page shows a feed from the Udacity Blog with relevant topics. At the bottom of the page you will find jasmine, with all test passed.

# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## What did I learn?

I learnt how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.
